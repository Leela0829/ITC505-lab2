    <h1>Internet of Things (IoT)-Based Teaching and Learning</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>
            1. ABSTRACT
        </h2>
        <p>
            The effect of technology has caused many institutions to intend to change their approach
            to teaching and learning, resulting in the current model of teaching and learning being an active
            collaborative and self-directed one. The connection between education and technology has received
            attention as part of educational policy and practice. Debatable topics like how to use technology
            in the classroom have therefore punctuated complaints about declining educational standards,
            unemployed learners, duplicate curricula, and archaic institutional structure. In the framework
            of information and communication technologies and societal growth, the Internet of Things (IoT)
            is asserting its vital position. Institutions may improve learning outcomes with the use of the
            Internet of Things by offering enhanced learning experiences, increasing operational effectiveness,
            and collecting real-time, actionable insight into student performance. The current state of the Internet
            of Educational Things (IoET) is examined from several educational perspectives in this article; a
            few of them are highlighted, and both of their established and potential educational benefits are
            discussed.

        <h2>
            2.  INTRODUCTION
        </h2>
        <p>
            The “God’s Architect” Antoni Gaud introduced a fluid building style in 19th-century
            Spain by building them as three-dimensional scale models and shaping the details as he had
            them in his head. His buildings’ expressive curves were not only functional load-bearing
            elements but also beautiful disguises. The “Internet of Things”, also referred to as the
            “Internet of Objects”, is a network of physical objects such as cars, appliances, and other
            household items that are connected and can exchange data. These objects are implanted
            with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity. This type of system can
            be summarily described as a network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and
            other items. Each object has an embedded computing system that makes it uniquely
            identifiable, but they can all work together within the current Internet infrastructure. The
            vision of the Internet of Things, according to Wigmore [2], has developed as a result of
            the confluence of several technologies, including ubiquitous wireless connection, real-time
            analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems.

        <h2>
            3. THEORETICAL CONCEPT
        </h2>
        <p>
            According to a common definition of the Internet of Things, it is a network of individually
            addressed objects (devices) that use Internet technology to locate and communicate
            with one another. The Internet of Things, one of the new paradigms that has emerged
            as a result of the Internet’s recent rapid growth, is one of information and communication
            technology’s hottest and most intriguing topics. Horizon Reports are regarded as
            reliable studies that look at the most recent breakthroughs in education and educational
            technology. In the context of substantial advancements in educational technology for higher
            education, one of the technologies in the 2017 Horizon Report that is projected to enable
            adaptation within 2–3 years is the Internet of Things paradigm. The concept and
            principles of the Internet of Things need to be understood by students who are going to
            use such technology in their professional lives over the coming years, as well as employees
            who will always leap towards this technology.
        <br>
        The following research questions served as the guide for the multi-phased search, evaluation, and analyses of academic articles on the IoT for this study:
        <ul>
            <li>What does the IoT (Internet of Things) technology for education mean?</li>
            <li>What are the advantages of education, according to publications from recognized research?</li>
            <li>What are the most recent developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) for education
                and what challenges remain?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

            4. MODERN TRENDS OF IoT-BASED TEACHING AND LEARNING
        </h2>
        <p>
            The pace of schooling is accelerating due to the introduction of new technology and the
            emergence of generations who are tech-aware. IoT-enabled education solutions, including
            interactive displays, digital boards, language laboratories, tablets, and school security
            software, are essential for meeting the demands of these children as well. By enabling
            educational institutions to become Wi-Fi-enabled smart learning environments, the IoT
            is revolutionizing the education sector. The whole integration, intercommunication, and
            synchronization processes in modern smart systems can now be enabled via Wi-Fi and
            sensor technologies. Increasing Internet accessibility at the community level has always
            been difficult, but thanks to the IoT in education, we can alter classrooms even further and
            make technology use easier even in rural places.

        <h2>
            5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
        </h2>
        <p>This study made an effort to give a broad overview of current trends and unresolved issues in using IoT-based teaching and learning and its applications in diverse fields. Attempting
    `       to maintain a barrier between the academic setting and the most cutting-edge,contemporary technologies implies a significant loss for education in terms of communication and collaborative activities, as well as learning. More and more students refuse to use
            paper documents in favor of smartphones, tablets, and computers, which provide them
            access to the necessary information at their fingertips and the flexibility to learn at their
            own pace. Due to the increased effectiveness and student-centeredness of instructional
            techniques, this trend also benefits teachers. Teachers can concentrate on providing individualized
            care and attention to each student while collaborating with them via IoT-connected
            devices to modify their lessons and hands-on assignments. The IoT offers educational
            institutions, teachers, and students a variety of chances in general.

            6. CONCLUSION
        </h2>
        <p>
            The education sector also started to realize the value of technology and how essential
            it is to the edtech industry. The IoT, or the Internet of Things, is a digital technology that
            is quickly developing in the education sector. Furthermore, it is successfully improving
            the current educational system. To maximize technology, the education sector is changing
            IoT devices and related services. This system helps to make education more dynamic,
            inclusive, and participatory. Furthermore, it enables interactive learning, guarantees the
            security of the educational facilities, increases productivity, provides real-time learning
            opportunities, enables close observation, etc. Additionally, providing your students with
            IoT devices as teaching aids makes for a truly engaging learning environment. E-learning,
            which has grown by 900% since 2000, is the sector of the education business with the
            fastest growth.
